# Introduction

MAGPIE is a project in its early stages and looking to invite contributors and maintainers. 

The project aims to provide a core suite of functions across multiple programming language. The intention is for each language to have a separate library and interface. Active repositories are 

- [`magpie-matlab`](https://github.com/Nemus-Project/magpie-matlab)
- [`magpie-python`](https://github.com/Nemus-Project/magpie-python)
  - [`magpie-jupyter`:](https://github.com/Nemus-Project/magpie-jupyter) Jupyter Notebook interface to `magpie-python` library


# Contribution Ideas

- review a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Nemus-Project/magpie-matlab/pulls)
- [fix an Issue or make a Feature Request](https://github.com/Nemus-Project/magpie-matlab/issues) 
- update the [documentation](https://github.com/Nemus-Project/Nemus-Project.github.io/tree/main/projects/magpie)
- write a tutorial or an example
- make an interface

It is expected that MAGPIE should be cross-platform, but there is always situations where platform specific changes must be made. Please add in the pull request if any changes were tested in a single OS or if they do not function corrrectly across platforms.

# Pull Requests
