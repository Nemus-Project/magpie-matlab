%% magpie
% An open source MATLAB library for working with thin plates with generalized elastic boundary conditions. 
% The framework is designed around two key use cases
% 
% # Exploration of plates for understanding how material properties affect mode shapes and modal frequencies.
% # Derivation of material properties from experimental data.
