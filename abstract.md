## Main Abstract

    There exist online tools for deriving modes for physical acoustic system, but they are rarely extensive 
and open source. Our goal is to create a tool that is accessible, easy to use and free open source software.
EigenPlate is software developed as part of the Numerical Restoration of Historical Musical Instruments
[NEMUS] project. EigenPlate is derived from a MATLAB source tool developed to derive mode shapes and mode
frequencies from parameterised physical properties of an isotropic thin plate.

    In additon, EigenPlate provides interactive elements for a more intuitive approach to parameter 
exploration. Using current, open-source, non-proprietary development platforms EigenPlate allows for easy 
access an exploration of parameters of a thin plate mode and their effect on mode shapes and frequencies.

    Obtaining mode shapes for plates can provide useful way for instrument makers to further understand the 
material with which they are working. EigenPlate also aims to make easier to explain concepts such as mode shapes to a wider audience and as a potential research tool for curators of musical instrument collections as well as creative tool for artists.
