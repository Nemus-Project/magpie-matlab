## Main Abstract

There exist online tools for deriving modes for physical acoustic system, but they are rarely extensive and open source. Our goal is to create a tool that is accessible, easy to use and free open source software. EigenPlate is software developed as part of the Numerical Restoration of Historical Musical Instruments [NEMUS] project. EigenPlate is derived from a MATLAB source tool developed for deriving mode shapes and mode frequencies, where physical properties of an isotropic thin plate are parameterised. Interactive elements provide a more intuitive approach to parameter exploration.

Using current, open-source, non-proprietary development platforms EigenPlate allows for easy access an exploration of parameters of a thin plate mode and their effect on mode shapes and frequencies. 

Obtaining mode shapes for plates can provide useful way for instrument makers to further understand the material with which they are working. EigenPlate aims to also make conceptualising concepts such as mode patterns to a wider audience and has potential as a research tool for curators of musical instrument collections as well as creative tool for artists.

<!--Online their exist tools for deriving modes for physical acoustic system but rarely are they extensive and open source." I would write "There exist online tools"}

"The EigenPlate is software developed as part of the Numerical Restoration of Historical Musical Instruments [NEMUS] project. Part of the NEMUS project remit is developing projects for the digital simulation and conservation of historic musical instruments. "

Maybe make it one sentence to describe NEMUS ?
