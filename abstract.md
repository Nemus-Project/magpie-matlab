## Main Abstract

  There exist online tools for deriving modes for physical acoustic system, but
they are rarely extensive and open source. The aim of the project is to create a
tool that is accessible, easy to use and free open source software. EigenPlate
is software developed as part of the Numerical Restoration of Historical Musical
Instruments [NEMUS] project. EigenPlate is derived from a MATLAB source tool
developed to derive mode shapes and mode frequencies from parameterised physical
properties of an isotropic thin plate.

  In addition, EigenPlate provides interactive elements for a more intuitive
approach to parameter exploration. Using current, open-source, non-proprietary
development platforms EigenPlate allows for easy access an exploration of
parameters of a thin plate mode and their effect on mode shapes and frequencies.

  Obtaining mode shapes for plates can provide useful way for instrument makers
to further understand the material with which they are working. EigenPlate also
aims to make easier to explain concepts such as mode shapes to a wider audience
and as a potential research tool for curators of musical instrument collections
as well as creative tool for artists.

## Michele's proposal

The analysis and simulation of plate vibration are central to many branches of science and engineering,
including acoustics and musical acoustics. Well-developed plate theories exist, along with 
numerous simulation software packages. These, however, are seldom available in open-source form and, hence, 
are not easily accessible to a greater audience. In this work, a novel finite difference scheme
for plates under general elastic boundary support is derived. In this framework, free, clamped, and simply supported 
boundary conditions are obtainable as limiting cases by setting the stiffness of the boundary 
supports to very small or large values. An interactive, free and open-source (pyhton-based?) web app is developed 
supporting several functionalities (we should spend a couple of words describing the kind of functionalities we offer). 
EigenPlate aims to make it easier to explain concepts such as mode shapes to a wider audience
and as a potential research tool for students, scientists and musical instrument builders, as well as creative tool for artists.
