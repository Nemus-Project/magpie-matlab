## Main Abstract

  There exist online tools for deriving modes for physical acoustic system, but
they are rarely extensive and open source. The aim of the project is to create a
tool that is accessible, easy to use and free open source software. EigenPlate
is software developed as part of the Numerical Restoration of Historical Musical
Instruments [NEMUS] project. EigenPlate is derived from a MATLAB source tool
developed to derive mode shapes and mode frequencies from parameterised physical
properties of an isotropic thin plate.

  In addition, EigenPlate provides interactive elements for a more intuitive
approach to parameter exploration. Using current, open-source, non-proprietary
development platforms EigenPlate allows for easy access an exploration of
parameters of a thin plate mode and their effect on mode shapes and frequencies.

  Obtaining mode shapes for plates can provide useful way for instrument makers
to further understand the material with which they are working. EigenPlate also
aims to make easier to explain concepts such as mode shapes to a wider audience
and as a potential research tool for curators of musical instrument collections
as well as creative tool for artists.

## Michele's proposal

PlateVibe: a web-based, open-source interactive tool for plate vibration simulation

The analysis and simulation of plate vibration are central to many branches of science and engineering,
including acoustics and musical acoustics. Well-developed plate theories exist, along with 
numerous simulation software packages. These, however, are seldom available in open-source form and, hence, 
are not easily accessible to a greater audience. This work presents a novel finite difference scheme
for plates under general elastic boundary support. In this framework, one can assess the effects of the 
elastic supports on the eigenfrequencies and modal shapes and retrieve the free, clamped, and simply supported 
boundary conditions as limiting cases. 
An interactive, free and open-source (pyhton-based?) web app is developed 
supporting several functionalities (we should spend a couple of words describing the kind of functionalities we offer). 
PlateVibe (name can change) offers a free, open-source and reliable alternative to simulate elastic plate vibration. 
It is a powerful research tool for students, scientists, and musical instrument builders.
